## Determining the Best Time Interval for Measuring the Home Ranges of Wildebeests in the Serengeti Desert

Using ArcGIS pro and data we obtained from the movebank, we used GIS to analyze and measure the movements of 5 randomly chosen wildebeests during the months of June 2011 - August 2011. 

### Methods
* Jaccard Self-Similarity Index
  * Used to measure how self-similar two objects are. In our case, we are comparing the intersected regions areas with the union areas. 

* Convex Hull:
  * We used Convex Hulls to create areas of movement for each time interval combination we measured

* Union / Intersect
  * In order to calculate the self-similarity index, we needed the intersection and union of each combination for the same time interval
